# 4FunctionCalculator
Four function calculator made using javafx. Allows addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First real personal project, not perfect but a good learning experience.
There are a few bugs I've found that I haven't fixed because I'm ready to move on.
The bugs are:
1) zeros in decimal numbers don't appear unitl a non zero number button is bushed.
2) formatting issues with larger decimals
3) I don't like how the label border wraps to the text, I couldn't figure out how to make it fixed.
